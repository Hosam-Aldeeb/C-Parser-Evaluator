# C++ Parser and Evaluator

A C++ parser and boolean evaluator program is a software tool that takes in a string representation of a boolean expression and processes it to determine its truth value. The parser component of the program is responsible for analyzing the structure of the input expression and verifying that it is syntactically correct. The evaluator component of the program then uses the parsed expression to determine whether it is true or false. This type of program is often used in the development of compilers and interpreters, as well as in automated theorem provers and other applications that require the manipulation of boolean expressions.
